# About

The tax base in Allegheny County shifts as buildings are built, others are demolished, and property owners appeal their assessments. These changes are reflected on a county webpage that is updated every Friday.

This dashboard tracks weekly shifts in real estate values and measures the impacts on tax revenue. It is powered by a scraper that pulls data from the county every week.

## Changelog

**Feb. 16, 2025**: added coverable info button to summary cards; upgraded chart tooltip to show both YTD and weekly change; added ability to see YTD and weekly change in municipality summary table.
