# About

The tax base in Allegheny County shifts as buildings are built, others are demolished, and property owners appeal their assessments. These changes are reflected on a county webpage that is updated every Friday.

This dashboard tracks weekly shifts in real estate values and measures the impacts on tax revenue. It is powered by a scraper that pulls data from the county every week.
